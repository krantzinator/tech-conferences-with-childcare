# Tech Conferences With Childcare

## How it works

In the [CodeNewbie](http://www.codenewbie.org) Twitter chat tonight (4/5/2017), several people mentioned lack of childcare as a barrier for their attendance at tech conferences. I thought a list like this should exist, so I made one.

Make a PR to add a conference to the list! PRs also welcome to improve the template.
